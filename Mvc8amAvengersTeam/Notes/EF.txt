Entity Framework is an orm model (object relational mapping model)
it map your c# object with database object
according to your E.F you should not write any database object at the application side
you should treat your database object as a class object

E.F contain two important classes on which it is standing 
1)Model
2)Context


what is the benifit of using EF?

-> you don't need to write large amount of code like in ado.net you write
few line of code is enough to complete your operation

->EF Create database Queries at backend internally behalf of developers
-->EF also Create database,table behalf of you

--->you don't need write large of amount of code to map how you map in
ado.net .here it Automatically map c# object with database object.

---->you can Create Application using E.F more faster  Compare to Ado.net 

Q)how many types of Approaches we have in E.F?
---> EF have 3 types of Approaches to perform dataccess operation
1)Database First Approaches
           --->you can use DFA if you have existing database and table ready with you.
based on your Table $$$>Model class and Context Class is going to be Automatically Generated.

2)Code First Approach
       ---->you can use CFA if you don't have any existing database,tables at that time you 
can go for code First Approach

Here you are going to Create Model class  and Context Class manually based on that
db and table going automatically generated 

3)Model First Approach
it uses EF Designer Window by using that GUI you will define Property
and based on that Model class,context class and Script is going to be gnerated
